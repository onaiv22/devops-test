As a result of time constraint, I couldnt finish this infra. But the following still needs to be done.
1 - proper testing of launch-configuration to deploy actual instance
2 - provisioners seems to be taking too long hence create a IAM role with access to s3
3 - Push your app to s3 from jenkins server
4 - Pull down files onto ec2 instance from s3 with aws cli command  using user_data
5 - Automate IAM Role creation
